Librarian manages Google Cloud client libraries. It runs a local workflow
that onboards new APIs, generates client code, bumps versions, publishes
releases, and tags release commits. Language-specific work, such as code
generation, building, and testing, is delegated to per-language tooling.

All behavior is driven by librarian.yaml at the root of the repository,
whose schema is documented at
https://github.com/googleapis/librarian/blob/main/doc/config-schema.md.

Usage:

	librarian <command> [arguments]

Global flags:

	--verbose, -v    enable verbose logging

# Read and write librarian.yaml configuration

Usage:

	librarian config [get|set] [path] [value]

# Get a configuration value

Usage:

	librarian config get [path]

# Set a configuration value

Usage:

	librarian config set [path] [value]

# Add a new client library

Usage:

	librarian add <api>

add registers a single API in librarian.yaml.

The <api> is a path within the configured googleapis source, such as
"google/cloud/secretmanager/v1". The library name and other defaults are
derived from the first API path using language-specific rules.

If the API path should naturally be included in an existing library, and if the
language supports doing so, that library is modified. Otherwise, a new library
is created.

To add a preview client of an existing library, prefix the API path with
"preview/".

Examples:

	librarian add google/cloud/secretmanager/v1
	librarian add preview/google/cloud/secretmanager/v1beta

A typical librarian workflow for adding a new client library is:

	librarian add <api>            # onboard a new API into librarian.yaml
	librarian generate <library>   # generate the client library

# Generate a client library

Usage:

	librarian generate <library>

generate produces client library code from the APIs configured in
librarian.yaml.

The library name argument selects a single library to regenerate. Use the
--all flag to regenerate every library in the workspace instead. Exactly
one of <library> or --all must be provided.

Generation is delegated to the language-specific tooling configured in
librarian.yaml. Libraries marked with skip_generate are skipped.

Examples:

	librarian generate <library>   # regenerate one library
	librarian generate --all       # regenerate every library

Flags:

	--all       generate all libraries

A typical librarian workflow for regenerating every library against the
latest API definitions is:

	librarian update googleapis
	librarian generate --all

# Bump version numbers and prepare release artifacts

Usage:

	librarian bump <library>

bump updates version numbers and prepares the files needed for a new release.

If a library name is given, only that library is updated. The --all flag updates every
library in the workspace. When a library is specified explicitly, the --version flag can
be used to override the new version.

Examples:

	librarian bump <library>           # update version for one library
	librarian bump --all               # update versions for all libraries

Flags:

	--all             update all libraries in the workspace
	--version string  specific version to update to; not valid with --all

# Install tool dependencies for a language

Usage:

	librarian install [language]

install installs the language-specific tools that librarian uses to
generate and build client libraries (for example, language SDKs and code
generators).

If [language] is omitted, the language is read from librarian.yaml in the
current directory.

Examples:

	librarian install              # use language from librarian.yaml
	librarian install go           # install Go-specific tools

# Tidy and validate librarian.yaml

Usage:

	librarian tidy

tidy reads librarian.yaml, validates its contents, applies any
language-specific defaults and normalization, and writes the file back
with a canonical formatting.

Run tidy after editing librarian.yaml by hand, or as a quick check that
the configuration is well-formed.

# Update sources or version to the latest version

Usage:

	librarian update <version | source>...

update refreshes the upstream source repositories declared in
librarian.yaml to their latest commits and updates the recorded commit
SHAs in librarian.yaml accordingly. It also supports updating the librarian version.

Supported targets:

  - conformance: protocolbuffers/protobuf conformance tests
  - discovery: googleapis/discovery-artifact-manager
  - googleapis: googleapis/googleapis (the API definitions)
  - protobuf: protocolbuffers/protobuf
  - showcase: googleapis/gapic-showcase
  - version: the librarian tool version

At least one target must be specified.

Examples:

	librarian update googleapis
	librarian update googleapis protobuf
	librarian update version

A typical librarian workflow for regenerating every library against the
latest API definitions is:

	librarian update googleapis
	librarian generate --all

# Publish client libraries

Usage:

	librarian publish

publish releases the libraries that were updated in a release commit
prepared by librarian bump.

By default, publish performs a dry run that prints the actions it would
take. Pass --execute to actually publish. By default, the most recent
release commit reachable from HEAD is used; --release-commit overrides
this with a specific commit.

The --dry-run, --dry-run-keep-going, and --skip-semver-checks flags are
only honored when the workspace language is Rust; they are retained for
backwards compatibility with the legacy Rust release jobs and will be
removed once Rust migrates to the unified flow.

Examples:

	librarian publish                          # dry run
	librarian publish --execute                # publish for real
	librarian publish --release-commit=<sha>   # publish a specific commit

Flags:

	--execute                fully publish (default is to only perform a dry run)
	--release-commit string  the release commit to publish; default finds latest release commit
	--dry-run                print commands without executing (legacy Rust-only flag)
	--dry-run-keep-going     print commands without executing, don't stop on error (legacy Rust-only flag)
	--skip-semver-checks     skip semantic versioning checks (legacy Rust-only flag)
	--verbose, -v            streams output of publishing commands executed

# Tag a release commit based on the libraries published

Usage:

	librarian tag

tag creates git tags on a release commit, one tag per library that the
commit released, using the tag_format declared for each library in
librarian.yaml.

Run tag after librarian publish has succeeded. By default, the most
recent release commit reachable from HEAD is used; --release-commit
overrides this with a specific commit.

The --create-release-tag flag additionally creates a tag of the form
release-<PR number>; this is used by the legacy release jobs and will be
removed once those jobs are retired.

Examples:

	librarian tag
	librarian tag --release-commit=<sha>
	librarian tag --create-release-tag

Flags:

	--release-commit string  the release commit to tag; default finds latest release commit
	--create-release-tag     whether to create a tag of the form release-{PR number}

# Print the binary version

Usage:

	librarian version

version prints the librarian binary version and exits. The version is
embedded at build time and follows the conventions described at
https://go.dev/ref/mod#versions.
